### Background

In this assignment, We will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Completed the following steps:
- Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.
- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Used sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
- Used otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
- Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

## Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Used otu_ids for the x values.
- Used sample_values for the y values.
- Used sample_values for the marker size.
- Used otu_ids for the marker colors.
- Used otu_labels for the text values.
